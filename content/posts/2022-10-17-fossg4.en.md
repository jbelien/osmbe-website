title: "FOSS4G & State of the Map Belgium 2022"
---

Join us for a free full day of talks and discussions about OpenStreetMap in Brussels, on Thursday November 17th 2022.

The OSGEO community (the people behind tools like QGIS and much more) have been organizing a conference for their users and developers since 2015. In 2019 we did an OSM track during the conference. Then covid happened, but now we're back with a fully shared conference. There's two equal tracks. The FOSS4G track focuses on the use and development of open source geo software. Meanwhile, the State of the Map track focuses on OSM in Belgium. Expect talks on the challenges of working with OpenStreetMap data and about projects to improve the map.

The call for maps is still open!
